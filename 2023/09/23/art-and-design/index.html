        <p>I love graphic design, but I hate drawing; I enjoy writing, but I don’t like reciting dictionaries. The former, design, the latter, art.</p>
<p>Art and design are closely related but subtly different fields. Painters can be great designers when they utilize their professional skills, color sensation and great feeling on shapes. But we can design nice visual works without those skills. We just use simple lines, shapes or icons. A better example lies in the movie industry. There are some director-actors, but very few. Most of the directors can not perform. That does not impair their talent in directing. We as creators always start small. But as our little artifact grow and flourish, they confronts the serious problem of composing. Things won’t fit easily if you have millions of small pieces, so we need carefully arrange them. That process - carefully arrange things to fit certain needs - is designing, a subject that has its own law and convention.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this article to discuss some rules in designing. I will start describing the general preferences in designing, and afterwards, from various examples, to deduce the unavoidable design trade-offs; which leads us to a situation where we are not free to choose one aspect rather than another. We have to balance them, that’s where all peculiar came in.</p>
<h2 id="General-Considerations"><a href="#General-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="General Considerations"></a>General Considerations</h2><p>Unlike artworks, design is bound by very specific needs. To satisfy these requirements, designers carefully tailor their products, which is guided by their mindset in classify and analysis problems. In this section, I am going to discuss several aspects, which are common in nearly every designing situations.</p>
<h3 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h3><p>Who are going to use your product and how will they use it? That’s the central question in a design process. When designing a book, for example, authors must consider their readers. For junior or foreign readers, the writing should be easy and illustrative for them to understand. On the contrary, if the book is intended for professional and senior readers, the easy way may not suffice.</p>
<p>In graphical design, the question poses many challenges. For example, we may write some information in small font or use color to convey some message. The elders may have difficulties recognize the former, and the latter fails to reach people having problem in colors.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the problem raises because authors and their audiences are different. They are people of different gender, age, height or culture. So the author may not understand their audiences well, yet they must strive to perceive their needs, either through feedback or experience.</p>
<h3 id="Medium"><a href="#Medium" class="headerlink" title="Medium"></a>Medium</h3><p>I often find it funny that many writers are obsessed with portraying things. Those items are pictured in elaborate words, but I can’t really imagine it. To me these sentences are invalid. Texts are not good at this purpose, maybe they should try to use images. A good image in book beats all those words.</p>
<p>So here’s my pick on purpose &amp; media:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>media</th>
<th>well-suited purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Text</td>
<td>ideas, emotion, narrate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Image</td>
<td>description, idea, emotion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Music</td>
<td>emotion, propaganda</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Video</td>
<td>all</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="Trade-offs"><a href="#Trade-offs" class="headerlink" title="Trade-offs"></a>Trade-offs</h2><p>I have talked about different choices in designing, now I want to talk about something that cannot be chosen, but must be carefully balance, or handle.</p>
<h3 id="Spacing-and-Detailing"><a href="#Spacing-and-Detailing" class="headerlink" title="Spacing and Detailing"></a>Spacing and Detailing</h3><p>Spacing vs. detailing is the first trade-off I want to talk in designing. In Web styling, leaving out enough spaces for every things is very important, otherwise the webpage became dense and people get difficulties reading them.</p>
<p>There I want to talk more on literature. It’s not a good practice to detail everything. When we write about one thing, we should somehow omit repeats. For example, in Dai Zhang’s writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In December, Chong Zhen’s 5th year, I was living near the West Lake. A heavy snow lasted for three days. All sounds of people and birds disappeared. At dawn, I rode a little boat, wearing fur clothes and bringing fire pots, towards the Pavilion of Central Lake alone, to appreciate snow. Fog of snowflakes covered the water; the heaven, the clouds, the mountain, the water, all appeared to be white. Shadows in lake only spares one cut of the Dam, one point of the Pavilion, and one slice of my boat with several dots of passages. (rough trans. by me, way too bad :p )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of saying how I love this short passage, I want to talk about why I don’t hate it.</p>
<p>The author depicts the scenery very concisely, yet his words are very precise. He did not bother writing the whole lonely and deadly world by detailing everything. He chose several typical sensations, for example, sounds, snow. The view is quite familiar to every readers(except those who live near the equator, of course). We readers recall the similar view buried in our heart, and fill details. In that way, the author not only informed us what he saw at that time, but also provoked us the same emotion, the same psyche. He, a wandering bard at 17th century, connects to us. We are invited as his guests across time and space. That’s charming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The connection is not always easy to form. If the writer writes too much, the overwhelming details clutters the true feeling of him. Readers feel lost in words. Worse, they start to suspect whether the author is honest. So we prune the text, but not too much. That’s the trade-off of spacing and detailing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author did not bother writing his emotion, or argues about anything as well. Instead of saying like, Oh, this place is truly a misanthropist’s heaven, he just remains silent.</p>
