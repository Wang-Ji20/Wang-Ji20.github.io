    <h1>
    art and design
</h1>

<p>
    <p>I love graphic design, but I hate drawing; I enjoy writing, but I don’t like reciting dictionaries. The former, design, the latter, art.</p>
<p>Art and design are closely related but subtlely different fields. Painters can be great designers when they utilize their professional skills, color sensation and great feeling on shapes. But we can design nice visual works without those skills. We just use simple lines, shapes or icons. A better example lies in the movie industry. There are some director-actors, but very few. Most of the directors can not perform. That does not impair their talent in directing. We as creators always start small. But as our little artifact grow and flourish, they confronts the serious problem of composing, where lies the whole landscape of design.</p>
