title: R for data science
---

    We need to make it clear that no one uses R to build operating systems; that no one uses R to create video games; that data scientists use R to visualize, tidy, analyze, and model data.

    Since data processing is the main goal of R, its syntax differs from general propose programming languages, whose syntax & semantics are designed to be explicit and simple. Instead, R's syntax is concise and expressive, but somehow confusing. To understand that, we need to dive in the problem R is trying to solve, and dig in its semantics.
