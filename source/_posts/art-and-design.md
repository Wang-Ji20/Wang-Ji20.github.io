I love graphic design, but I hate drawing; I enjoy writing, but I don't like reciting dictionaries. The former, design, the latter, art.

Art and design are closely related but subtlely different fields. Painters can be great designers when they utilize their professional skills, color sensation and great feeling on shapes. But we can design nice visual works without those skills. We just use simple lines, shapes or icons. A better example lies in the movie industry. There are some director-actors, but very few. Most of the directors can not perform. That does not impair their talent in directing. We as creators always start small. But as our little artifact grow and flourish, they confronts the serious problem of composing. Things won't fit easily if you have millons of small pieces, so we need carefully arrange them. That process is designing, a subject that has its own law and convention.

It is the purpose of this article to discuss some rules in designing. I will start describing the general preferences in designing, and afterwards, from various examples, to deduce the unavoidable design trade-offs; which leads us to a situation where we are not free to choose one aspect rather than another. We have to balance them, that's where all peculiar came in.

## Taxonomy

Unlike artworks, design is bound by specific needs. To satisfy these requirements, designers tailor their products, which is guided by their mindset in classify and analysis problems.

## Trade-offs

I have talked about different choices in designing, now I want to talk about something that cannot be chosen, but must be carefully balance, or handle.

### Spacing and Detailing

### Unifying and varying

### leisure and difficult?

## art and design, revisited
