AI coding tools are taking the world for storm. It is no longer worthy to debate whether we should adapt it; it is how to use it that matters. This article will discuss several issues that I reckon recently about it.

There are three sections:
- What AI can do?
- What we still need to do in a project?
- How to collaborate with the AI? / what we need to do more with AI?
- What this bring to our work environment?

## What AI can do

Two kind of coding assistants:

1. inline completion
    github copilot & cursor
    They mainly suggests the user the next step.

2. coding agent
    codex & claude code
