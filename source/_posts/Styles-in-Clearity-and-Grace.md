*Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace* is the best book on writing that I have ever read. Strunk & White is, of course, great, but their principles are not as applicable as that one. Flexible, but too hard for beginners.

I am going to summarize the book in this article, while reflecting on my own writings.

## Writing as a craft

It's good to write clear, and everyone can do this.

The difficulty comes from the fact that readers and writers know different things. Writers know more, so they are susceptible to a false belief that their writings are clear.

So we need to perceive how readers respond to our prose, and adjust our words to better serve them. That process needs carefully revision. But not in the drafting phase. At that time you just write everything, and you get a version that is complete. Then you start your revision and make it better. Iterative refinement.
